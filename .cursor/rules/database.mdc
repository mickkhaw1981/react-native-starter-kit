## Prisma
- Prisma as the Source of Truth over Supabase
- Manage DB logic with Prisma in `prisma/schema.prisma. All schema changes should be tracked through migrations. 
- snake_case table â†’ camelCase fields.
- No raw SQL; run `npx prisma migrate dev`, never use `npx prisma db push`.
- **Never delete or alter critical data without explicit confirmation.** Operations should be carefully controlled.
