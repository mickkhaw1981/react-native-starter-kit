## React Native Expo Structure
- Use Expo Router
- Project structure can be found in [project-structure.md](mdc:docs/project-structure.md)

## Env Rules
- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
