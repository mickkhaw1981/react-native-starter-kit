## Sequential Thinking
- Use **Sequential Thinking MCP** for debugging, troubleshooting, complex problem-solving, and detailed project planning. 
- Avoid excessive recursive calls; trigger intelligently only when new progress or significant information is possible.

## Information Gathering (Brave Search, Puppeteer, FireCrawl)
- Use **Brave Search, Fetch Puppeteer** when troubleshooting, searching documentation, or exploring similar user issues.
- Combine effectively with **Sequential Thinking MCP** to refine solutions and acquire up-to-date information.
- Prioritize reliable and concise sources.

## Browser Tools
- ***Browser Tools MCP** requires user confirmation. Always recommend the user explicitly start the server and ensure a Chromium browser is running before using Browser Tools MCP.
- Let the user explicitly instruct Cursor when Browser Tools should be used.
- Remind user to disable Puppeteer before attempting to use

## Screenshot Tools
- When you make a change to the UI, use Puppeteer's `screenshot` tool to show the changes. Save it in the ~/screenshots folder.
