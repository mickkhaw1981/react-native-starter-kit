## Documentation Usage
- Always consult the project's ***prd.md ** file located at the project root for clear understanding of goals and features..

If additional or updated documentation is required, use MCP servers (Brave Search, Puppeteer, Fetch) to locate official and current sources online.

## This Project's Tech Stack:
- React Native Expo
- React
- TypeScript
- NativeWind
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma for database ORM
- Supabase for database

## Icons
- Prefer `lucide-react-native`; name icons in PascalCase.
- Custom icons in `components/icons`.

## User Interface (UI) and Styling
- **Never change or affect the UI unintentionally. Only alter UI components if explicitly instructed or clearly part of the assigned task.
- Use Tailwind CSS (mobile-first, dark mode with dark:(class)). Extend brand tokens in `tailwind.config.ts`.


## Technical Stack Compliance
- **Adhere strictly to the project's established technology stack.**
- Do not introduce new technologies or packages unless explicitly instructed and justified.
- You may suggest alternative technologies if beneficial, but never implement them without user approval.
